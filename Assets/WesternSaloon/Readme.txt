Hi!
Thank you for purchasing my assets!

If you want to achieve the same bloom and tonemapper quality you can buy this asset, which I used in the video-demo: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/41369

For using doors and windows from this package with any other First Person Controller, please add a sphere trigger to your player's camera and set camera's tag to "MainCamera".

If you have problems with this package, please, let me know: support@not-lonely.com

P.S.: I'll be very happy if you leave a review and rate it on Asset Store! :)
Thank you again!
